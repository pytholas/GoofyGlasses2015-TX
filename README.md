Wireless DMX-style RGB LED lighting controler-- broadcast side.
This software was developed on Linux Mint, compiled with gcc, and requires libftdi and libcurses. Oh yeah, and an XBEE PRO S1 attached to a laptop via USB.
Goofy Glasses are high power LEDs and a microprocessor-based controller 
attached to sunglasses. These sunglasses can be worn by members of a musical 
group (such as a marching band) or other performing group and the LEDs can be 
controlled (on/off, color, brightness) via a wireless signal sent by a 
transmitter attached to a laptop computer.
